# Weather-Instablity-Analysis
This project is unlike usual data analytics projects. I decided to use techniques that I learned in my algorithms course over traditional machine learning techniques to find instabilities in the weather patterns in the United States. I have made use of a dynamic programming algorithm known as multiple linear regression that will help find analyse the instability in the weather and to make sense of the data.
